## Commit Message Format

Use the following format for all commits:

```
ASU-{short 10-15 words description what was done in this commit}
```

**Examples:**
- `ASU-Add unit tests for file manipulation and CSV writer`
- `ASU-Fix image upload bug in batch processing endpoint`
- `ASU-Update OpenAI API to use GPT-5-mini model`
- `ASU-Implement pre-commit hooks with Husky and Vitest`
- `ASU-Refactor server error handling for better user feedback`

**Guidelines:**
- Keep the description concise (10-15 words)
- Use present tense (Add, Fix, Update, Implement, Refactor)
- Be specific about what changed
- Focus on the "what" not the "how"
