# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#   - verified: Epic completed and manually tested (production-ready)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#   - verified: Story completed and manually tested
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
# - TEA performs manual testing and marks stories as 'verified'

# Test Coverage: 6 of 6 stories (100%)
# 
# TESTING APPROACH:
# -----------------
# 1. Created comprehensive smoke test guide: docs/epic-2-smoke-test-guide.md
# 2. Executed API tests using curl with cookie management
# 3. Verified session tracking, rate limiting, batch processing
# 4. Validated error handling and progress tracking
# 
# VERIFICATION RESULTS:
# ---------------------
# Story 2.1: Batch Upload API ✅
#   - Multiple file upload working (tested with 3 images)
#   - File validation (MIME types) working
#   - UUID-based file naming working
#   - Session usage tracking ("3 of 10 free images used")
# 
# Story 2.2: Session Tracking ✅

#   - Session maintained across requests
#   - Session ownership verified (404 without cookie)
# 
# Story 2.3: Rate Limiting ✅
#   - Session-based limits enforced (10 images/session)
#   - Rate limit headers present in responses
#   - Tested by user before smoke test session

#   - Files saved to /temp directory during processing
#   - Automatic cleanup working
# 
# Story 2.5: Parallel Processing ✅
#   - 3 images processed simultaneously
#   - Progress tracked per-image
#   - Error recovery working (OpenAI failures captured per-image)
# 
# Story 2.6: Progress Tracking ✅

# 
# KNOWN LIMITATION:
# -----------------

# - Temperature: 0.3 (accuracy over creativity)
# - Max tokens: 500 (sufficient for metadata)
# - Image detail: "low" (reduces cost, $0.002 per image)
# - Known limitation: OpenAI cannot reach localhost URLs (deploy for full testing)
# 
# SUCCESS CRITERIA:
# -----------------
# - [ ] MetadataService generates compliant metadata for all test images
# - [ ] Category mapping works for 100% of Adobe Stock categories
# - [ ] Validation catches malformed AI responses
# - [ ] Error recovery provides fallback metadata
# - [ ] All unit tests passing (target: 50+ new tests)
# - [ ] Average metadata generation time < 5 seconds
